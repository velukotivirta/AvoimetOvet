    <strong>Assembly of lasagna</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 pound freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water on the stovetop on high heat. </p>
        <p> It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil,</p>
        <p> so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>

        <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
        <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. </p>
        <p>Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
        <p>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>

        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef</li>
        <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet.</p>
        <p>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.</p>
        <p>Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.</p>
        <p>Return the browned ground beef to the pan.</p>
        <p>Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>

        <li>Make the sauce</li>
        <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized pot.</p>
        <p>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>
        <p>Add seasonings, sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar.</p>
        <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer.</p>
        <p>Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>

        <li>Boil and drain the lasagna</li>
        <p>Stir often to prevent from sticking.</p>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 celcius</li>
        <br>

        <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
        <p> Ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish.</p>
        <p>Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce.</p>
        <p>Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce.</p>
        <p>Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.</p>
        <p>Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce.</p>
        <p>Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.</p>
        <p>Finish with another layer of noodles.</p>
        <p>Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</p>

        <li>Bake</li>
        <p>Bake at 200 for 45 minutes. Uncover the foil-covered lasagna in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>

        <li>Cool and serve!</li>
    </ol>
